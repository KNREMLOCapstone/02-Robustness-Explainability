After the hyper parameter tuning, found out the best model to be vit out of (resnet18, resnet34, vit) for the intel dataset, generated the scripted model and tried to generate the explainability images and got cuda memory error so shifted back to resnet18 and generated the scripted model for resent18 and performed the explanations.
